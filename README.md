# Simple Quiz on US State Capitals - Homework 4

### Description

For this project, I built a simple multiple choice quiz testing users on their knowledge of US state capitals. The program contains a start button, a timer, a score counter, multiple questions, and a form to submit initials at the end.

When the start button is clicked, the user is taken to the first question in the quiz, and the timer begins counting down from 100.

If the user selects a correct answer, then an alert notifies them that the answer was correct, and their score increase by 1. They are taken automatically to the next question.

If the user selects an incorrect answer, then an alert notifies them that the answer was correct AND that 10 seconds will be deducted from the clock. The score remains unchanged, but 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer, and the user is automatically taken to the next question.

When the timer reaches zero OR the user completes every question, then an alert notifies the the user that the game is over and they are prompted with a form to submit their initials.
